## ðŸš€ Project Overview

The analysis covers the following key aspects:

- **Data Cleaning:**
  - Handled missing values, duplicates, and formatting inconsistencies.
  - Addressed missing entries (e.g., Total Amount) by replacing them with statistical measures.
  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
  - Calculated descriptive statistics (mean, median) for key metrics like Quantity, Price, and Total Amount.
  
- **Correlation Analysis:**
  - Analyzed relationships between sales variables to highlight key sales drivers.
  
- **Visualizations:**
  - Created charts to visualize trends over time, product category performance, and customer behavior patterns.
